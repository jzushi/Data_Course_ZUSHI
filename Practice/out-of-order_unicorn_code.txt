# Command-line code to find all the unique 2-base-pair starting values in ../Data/data-shell/creatures/unicorn.dat 

# It could be done more efficiently, sure, but I wrote 6 lines of code that would show me each unique combination 
# of the first 2 base-pairs of every sequence in that file. Don't ask me why I wanted to see that. It's personal.

# The problem is, though, that my dog was mad at me for not feeding him enough breakfast and he mixed up all the code.

# Can you please put it back into a logical order?




#here's the correct order code:

cd ./Data/data-shell/creatures

cp unicorn.dat unicorn.dat.backup

tail -160 unicorn.dat > just_seqs

cut -c 1,2 just_seqs > first_2_bases

sort first_2_bases | uniq > first_2_unique

cat first_2_unique
