#   1.  Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain
No, they show a p value of < 0.5 so they are significant. Looking at the plot we can see hwo the amount of nitrogen changes the growth rate. There is a point that is the most optimal for growth, and from the graph we can see that too little or too much nitrogen will change growth rate as well. Though we have some outliers, we don't have any points showing up below 0 so it makes sense that this data has significance. 
# 2.  In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships?  If so, do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with this in R
